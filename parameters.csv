1,conductivity,S m-1,,Seawater Conductivity,sea_water_electrical_conductivity,6,,,CONDWAT,Seawater conductivity refers to the ability of seawater to conduct electricity. The presence of ions in the seawater- such as salt- increases the electrical conducting ability of seawater. As such- conductivity can be used as a proxy for determining the quantity of salt in a sample of seawater. Units: S m-1,L1,Science
2,pressure,dbar,,Seawater Pressure,sea_water_pressure,3,,,PRESWAT,Seawater Pressure refers to the pressure exerted on a sensor in situ by the weight of the column of seawater above it. It is calculated by subtracting one standard atmosphere from the absolute pressure at the sensor to remove the weight of the atmosphere on top of the water column. The pressure at a sensor in situ provides a metric of the depth of that sensor. Units: dbar,L1,Science
3,salinity,(unitless),,Practical Salinity,sea_water_practical_salinity,3,,,PRACSAL,Salinity is generally defined as the concentration of dissolved salt in a unit of seawater. Practical Salinity is a more specific unitless quantity calculated from the conductivity of seawater and adjusted for temperature and pressure.
